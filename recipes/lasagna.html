        <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna</strong>: spread a thin layer of sauce over the bottom of the pan, then add
            a layer of lasagna sheet on top of the sauce; now add slices of fresh mozzarella and some
            grated parmigiano reggiano; as a finishing touch, add a few sprinkles of ground pepper; repeat the layering
            process until you fill the pan;
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bake the lasagna</strong>: Turn the oven to 180°C  to preheat it while you assemble the lasagna;
            Once the lasagna is assembled, cover the pan with a layer of aluminum foil; place the pan in the oven and
            bake it for 30 minutes, then remove the foil to make the cheese on top crunchy; the dish is ready when the
            internal temperature is at 75°C;
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cool and serve</strong>: remove the pan from the oven and let it cool for 15 minutes, then slice it up
            and serve!
