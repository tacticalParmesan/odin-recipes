# odin-recipes
This small project is the capstone assignment for the Odin Project's HTML 
Introduction. 
This webpage will contain links to some tasty recipes and will display every element as taught inside the module.

Following the "learn by doing" approach to learning new concepts, this is a great occasion for reviewing and applying the concepts that I learnt following along the module, in particular:
- Boilerplate html code
- Headers and paragraphs
- Links, list and images
